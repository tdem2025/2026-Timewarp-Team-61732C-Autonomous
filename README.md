This is Aerial Drone Competition Team 61732C's code for Mission 2026: Timewarp's autonomous skills  
-Autonomous.py is the actual autonomous code  
-Test.py is possible test code for basic flight  
-Fun.py is just some fun code :)  
-Emergany.py lol, is a piece of code written to, well, emergany stop 
-the_theory_of_relativity.py is code written that is theoretically perfect and will take go through the smaller hole, twice through the wind tunnel, and land on the blue cube
-Will push out releases every meeting code is worked on (untested code as beta, incomplete as alpha, complete and working as release).  
-Also if issues are found let's mark them under issues so we can keep track of them  
-You can send code to the drone through the Python Console for things like landing or emergency stopping
